# React Refresher

This is React app is a small website for 'NC Coffee Shop'. The project is currently 'broken' - it has quite a few errors popping up already and mistakes in the code.

Open up the project (which will spring up errors straight away) then look through the questions below, fixing the code as you go.

## Questions

1. The code above gives us a TypeError: `Cannot read property 'name' of undefined`. **Why are we getting this TypeError and how could we fix it?** Consider _what_ is undefined in this case then you can follow it through to find out why.

2. We are getting an error in the console: 'Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop'. **How could we fix this error?**

3. Ideally, we want it so that when the user clicks on a drink's delete button, the `removeDrink` method gets invoked. In reality, **when is the removeDrink method being invoked?**

4. **How can we change the code to ensure it will be invoked at the correct time?** There are _two_ ways you could do this, try and think of both.

5. Consider the removeDrink method - **how could the `setState` be improved?**

6. **Why do you think this change necessary?**
